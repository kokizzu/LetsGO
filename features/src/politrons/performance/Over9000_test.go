Use
----
Vegeta DSL require several parts to fill the response values [Metrics] of the process that run.
- We create a [Rate] which is how many request we will perform by time.
- We create a [Targeter] which contains the typical request info (method, url, headers, body)
- We create a [Duration] to specify how much time the performance process must take
- We create an [Attacker] which is the client that run the request using all the information we provide before.
- We create a [Metrics] which we will use to fill with the metrics info obtained by the [Result] of the Attacker client.

Once we have the DSL formed, we use [Attack] function passing all the arguments created before, and it will return a Response
value per each request which we will add into the [Metrics] type created previously.
This Metrics type it will generate all the telemetry info of all request info together.
